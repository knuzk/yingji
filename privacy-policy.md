# Privacy Policy

**YingJi Photo Viewer**  
_Last updated: July 7, 2025_

YingJi is a fast, simple photo viewer for macOS that respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how the app handles your data.

## 1. Data Collection

YingJi does **not collect**, store, or transmit any personal data.

- No account is required to use the app.
- No internet connection is used or required.
- No data is sent to external servers.
- No analytics or tracking tools are included.

## 2. Access to Files

YingJi allows users to browse and view images from their local folders, SD cards, or removable drives. The app only accesses files that you explicitly open or select. It does not scan or collect information about other parts of your file system.

## 3. Permissions

When running in a sandboxed environment (such as from the Mac App Store), YingJi requests access to folders and files using standard macOS system dialogs. This access is **granted and controlled entirely by the user**.

## 4. Local Processing Only

All image rendering and viewing is performed locally on your device using GPU acceleration. No images or metadata are uploaded or shared.

## 5. Third-Party Content

Screenshots and demo images shown in the App Store may include photos from [Unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com), which are free to use under the Unsplash license. These images are not bundled with the app.

## 6. Changes to This Policy

This policy may be updated in the future. Changes will be reflected in the version published alongside the app in the Mac App Store.

## 7. Contact
